      <p>
        SHE'S DRIVING A FERRARI DOWNTOWN <br>
        SHE LOOKS LIKE A BRIDE IN A GOWN <br>
        SHE'S A QUEEN IN A GOLDEN CROWN <br>
        WHEN SHE WALKS THE AISLE, THEY BOW DOWN <br><br>
        
        SAY WHAT? SHE'S A REAL DEAL HOTTIE <br>
        SAY WHAT? A REAL BADASS HONEY <br>
        SAY WHAT? SHE'S EXPENSIVE GOT THE MONEY <br>
        AND WHAT? SHE'S HOT BURNING FURY <br><br>
        
        HALO AND THORNS <br>
        SHE'S A DEVIL AND AN ANGEL <br>
        EVERY SIDE OF THE COIN <br>
        SHE'S A BEAUTY IN EACH ANGLE <br>
        WITH THE LOOK IN HER EYES <br>
        YEAH, BLOSSOMY AND LOVELY <br>
        I'VE NEVER KNOWN PARADISE <br>
        TILL I SAW WHAT'S IN FRONT OF ME <br><br>
        
        NO ORDINARY LAD <br>
        EVERYTHING AROUND IS BLUR <br>
        AND THE ONLY CLEAR SUBJECT <br>
        YOU CAN SEE IS HER <br>
        FADE AWAY FADE AWAY <br>
        ALL THE GIRLS FADE AWAY <br>
        MAKE A WAY MAKE A WAY <br>
        SHE'S COMING MY WAY <br><br>
        
        CITY LIGHTS AT NIGHT DIMS WHEN SHE WALKS ON BY THE STREET <br>
        SHE'S FLOATING, BUT SHE'S NOT FLYING <br>
        LIKE A SHOOTING STAR, EVERYBODY JUST LOOKS <br>
        ON HER DIRECTION, WITH FULL ATTENTION <br><br>
        
        CAN WE TALK UNTIL MIDNIGHT <br>
        AND MAKE LOVE UNTIL SUNLIGHT <br>
        THE SUMMER ISN'T HERE YET ITS HOTTER THAN HELL <br>
        YOU'RE COOLER THAN WINTER I'VE GOT CHILLS EVERYWHERE <br>

        ONE STEP TO THE LEFT <br>
        AND STEP TO THE RIGHT <br>
        HER BODY SWAYS IN GRACE FROM SIDE TO SIDE <br>
        NO NEED TO SHOW SKIN <br>
        NOR DRESS UP WITH A BLING <br>
        GLITTERS IN THE AIR WHEN SHE STARTS TO SING <br><br>
        
        SHE'S TEN, FROM HEAD TO TOE <br>
        SHE'S TEN, SO LITERALLY <br>

        CAN I BE WITH YOU RIGHT NOW <br>
        DO I GET A CHANCE SOMEHOW <br>
        I NEED A HUNDRED PERCENT OF ME NOW <br>
        IT'S OK IF I GO DOWN <br><br>
        
        JUST ONE LOOK, THAT IS ALL I NEED AND YOU WILL MAKE MY NIGHT <br>
        EVEN BETTER IF YOU SMILE THEN I COULD DIE TONIGHT <br>

        IF I SQUEEZE FROM HEAD TO TOE THERE IS JUICE IN EVERY PART OF YOU <br>
        BUT IT'S JUST A LUCID DREAM, NOT UNTIL I GET MY HANDS ON YOU <br>
        YOU'RE ALL OVER MY HEAD YEAH <br><br>

    <h4>ONE TIME</h4></div>
  <p>
    ONE PUFF, HOLD MY BREATH FOR A WHILE <br>
    I LEAN MY HEAD BACK, SEE THE HEAVEN <br>
    EYES CLOSED YET I SEE THE WHOLE WORLD <br>
    AM I IN DELUSION OR IS IT INNER VISION <br>
    JUST A SECOND AGO I SEE NOTHING AT ALL <br>
    I WAS SO STRESSED OUT <br>
    I WAS ALL WORKED UP <br>
    NOW I'M RELIEVED FROM THE PAIN THAT IS STOCKED IN MY BRAIN <br>
    NOW I FEEL LIKE I AM REBORN, YEAH <br><br>
    
    AWAKEN AND STRONG <br>
    I'M FINE ALL ALONG <br>
    I NEED NO REASON TO EXIST AT ALL <br>
    I'M IN CONTROL <br>
    JUDGE ME NO MORE <br>
    I DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND <br><br>
    
    ANOTHER PUFF THEN I COUGH SO HARD <br>
    MY FACE BECAME RED I STARTED LAUGHING <br>
    NOBODY'S MAKING A JOKE, EVERYTHING SEEMS FUNNY <br>
    THE WORLD IS FASCINATING <br>
    IT FEELS LIKE I JUST GOT OUT OF PRISON <br>
    EVERYTHING AROUND ME FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS SEASON <br>
    THE CHANGE I NEEDED THE WORLD TO BE <br>
    IS THE CHANGE I NEEDED IN ME, YEAH <br><br>
    
    AWAKEN AND STRONG <br>
    I'M FINE ALL ALONG <br>
    I NEED NO REASON TO EXIST AT ALL <br>
    I'M IN CONTROL <br>
    JUDGE ME NO MORE <br>
    I DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND <br><br>
    
    FAST PACE, RACING FOR EACH OTHER'S GLORY <br>
    DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOSE AND GAIN, ALL GOT A STORY <br>
    HERE'S A CHEERS TO UPS AND DOWNS <br>
    THERE'S NO NEED TO HURRY WORRY <br>
    GIVE THE BALL TO STEPHEN CURRY <br>
    THREE-POINT SHOT, TROPHY BABY <br><br>
    
    ONE TIME IS ALL IT TAKES <br>
    TO TURN THE TABLES AROUND <br>
    SWITCH TO A BETTER SIDE <br>
    AND FOR THE FIRST TIME <br>
    I'LL EMBRACE MY F****** NAME <br><br>
    
    TOO MANY YEARS OF SUFFERING NOW LOOK AT ME <br>
    TOO MANY LOST HOPES GOOD THING THAT HOPE IS FREE <br>
    I GOT A GOOD SIDE WISHING FOR THE BEST OF ME <br>
    I GOT A BAD SIDE, DON'T GO F****** WITH ME <br><br>
    
    TO ALL THE PEOPLE, THOSE WHO DOUBTED ME F*** YOU <br>
    TO ALL THE ONES WHO TRIED TO CONTROL ME F*** YOU <br> 
    TO EVERYONE WHO STAYED BY MY SIDE THANK YOU <br>
    TO ANYONE WHO'S WITH ME NOW, I THANK YOU 
    </p><br><br><br>

    <h4>THE TRAVELER</h4></div>
  
  <p>SOMEWHERE IN THE DESERT <br>
    UNDERNEATH THE SUN <br>
    DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME <br>
    I'M NOT SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE <br>
    I JUST WANT TO WANDER <br>
    I JUST WANT TO ROAM <br>
    THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY <br>
    I'M NOT LOST AT ALL <br><br>
    
    COZ IN THE BEDROOM <br>
    IN THE BATHROOM <br>
    IN THE KITCHEN <br>
    THERE ARE WALLS <br>
    I WANT SPACES <br>
    SEE MANY PLACES <br>
    THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN <br><br>
    
    COZ I KNOW HOW IT FEELS LIKE <br>
    TO BE KEPT AND LONELY INSIDE <br>
    SITTING ON A CHAIR ALL DAY WATCHING TV SHOWS <br>
    IT JUST BORES ME TO THE BONES <br>
    UP IN THE SKY I HOVER <br>
    ABOVE VAST AND LIVELY WATERS <br>
    LISTEN TO THE SOUND OF THE BREATHING GROUND <br>
    IT FEELS LIKE I'M HOMEBOUND <br><br>
    
    MEETING DIFFERENT PEOPLE <br>
    LEARNING DIFFERENT WAYS <br>
    DRIVE IN EVERY CITY <br>
    EAT THE FOOD BY THE STREETS <br>
    DIVING IN THE OCEAN <br>
    SEE THE CREATURES THERE <br>
    RIDING IN THE MOUNTAINS <br>
    AND BREATHE THE TASTY AIR <br><br>
    
    COZ IN THE BEDROOM <br>
    IN THE BATHROOM <br>
    IN THE KITCHEN <br>
    THERE ARE WALLS <br>
    I WANT SPACES <br>
    SEE MANY PLACES <br>
    THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN <br><br>
    
    COZ I KNOW HOW IT FEELS LIKE <br>
    TO BE KEPT AND LONELY INSIDE <br>
    SITTING ON A CHAIR ALL DAY WATCHING TV SHOWS <br>
    IT JUST BORES ME TO THE BONES <br>
    UP IN THE SKY I HOVER <br>
    ABOVE VAST AND LIVELY WATERS <br>
    LISTEN TO THE SOUND OF THE BREATHING GROUND <br>
    IT FEELS LIKE I'M HOMEBOUND <br><br>
    
    I, I WISH COULD FLY <br>
    COME WITH ME <br>
    IT IS MORE FUN <br>
    SOAK AND WET BENEATH THE SUN <br>
    MAKE NO PLANS, MAKE NO MISTAKES <br>
    LIFE IS BETTER WHEN YOU ARE WITH SOMEONE <br>
    IT COULD BE ANYONE <br><br>
    
    COZ IN THE BEDROOM <br>
    IN THE BATHROOM <br>
    IN THE KITCHEN <br>
    THERE ARE WALLS <br>
    I WANT SPACES <br>
    SEE MANY PLACES <br>
    THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN <br><br>
    
    COZ I KNOW HOW IT FEELS LIKE <br>

    ABOVE VAST AND LIVELY WATERS <br>

    IT FEELS LIKE I'M HOMEBOUND <br><br>
    
    LISTEN TO THE GROUND

    <h4>SIMPLE MAN</h4></div>
  
  <p>
    I'M A SIMPLE MAN WITH SIMPLE DREAMS <br>
    TO GAIN A WIFE AND KIDS TO RAISE <br>
    GIVE SHELTER AND PROTECTION TO THEM <br>
    BUILD A FIRE WHEN THE WEATHER IS COLD <br><br>
    
    I LIKE MY SIMPLE LIFE <br>
    LOVING MY SIMPLE WIFE <br>
    
    I NEVER NOTICE <br>
    WHEN I GROW OLD <br>
    I DON'T COUNT THE DAYS HAVE GONE <br>
    I HAVE LEARNED THIS <br>
    BEING CONTENTED <br>
    IS WHAT I REALLY NEEDED <br>
    IS WHAT I HAVE SUCCEEDED <br>
    AS LONG AS I DON'T HURT SOMEONE <br>
    THEN I AM UP TO A GOOD LIFE <br><br>
    
    I DO SIMPLE WORK IN MY DAILY ROUTINE <br>
    I TRY SOMETHING NEW WHEN I SEE AND I FEEL <br>
    AT THE END OF THE DAY, I SIT <br>
    WITH MY WIFE BY SIDE HOLDING HANDS <br><br>
    
    I LIKE MY SIMPLE LIFE <br>
    LOVING MY SIMPLE WIFE <br><br>
    
    I GROW MY OWN FOOD IN MY BACKYARD <br>
    FRUIT MEAT VEGGIES AND FISH <br>
    SHE GONNA SLICEM DICEM COOKEM <br>
    MAKE MY FAVORITE DISH <br>
    OPEN A BEER FOR ME AH <br>
    MASSAGE YOU LATER UHUH <br>
    SEE THE LATE LATE SHOW <br>
    JIMMY JIMMY CORDEN MAKE ME LAUGH HARD HAHA <br>
    SOME OTHER DAYS ON SPECIAL DAYS <br>
    WE GO FOR A VACATION <br>
    WHEN WE GOT NO MONEY, WE JUST DO A STAYCATION <br>
    I JUST LIKE TO CHILL WORK ON MY BILLS <br>
    I HATE PRESSURE COZ IT KILLS <br>
    KEEP IT SIMPLE KEEP IT PLAIN <br>
    IN LESS THERE'S MORE TO GAIN <br><br>
    
    I NEVER NOTICED <br>
    WHEN I GROW OLD <br>
    I DON'T COUNT THE DAYS HAVE GONE <br>
    I HAVE LEARNED THIS <br>
    BEING CONTENTED <br>
    IS HAVING YOU <br>
    ALL I REALLY WANTED IS YOU <br>
    I'M GONNA LIVE AND DIE WITH YOU <br>
    AND MY LAST WORDS WOULD BE <br>
    I LOVE YOU
